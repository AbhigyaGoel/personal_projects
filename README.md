# px to vw/vh
I'm currently working in React/TailwindCSS on a website for my debate team and I need it to be modular and resizable per screen, so every component is in vw or vh. I have a design done in Figma that's in 1920x1080, so I made a calculator to make px translation easier. Not the best use of my time considering desmos exists but I really hate frontend so whatever.
